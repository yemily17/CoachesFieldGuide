# 📍 Coaches Field Guide: Your Ultimate Hackathon Roadmap 🚀✨

### We’ve all been there: you’re Coaching a hackathon in a university conveniently located in the middle of nowhere, your brain is fried after a hellish red-eye on a Friday night after work, and you desperately need a three shots of espresso... or at least a hotel that understands the importance of keeping packages safe and sound in the back office. Look no further: our CoachesFieldGuide offers you the 411 on all the local spots.

# ✨ Features
## Hackathon Finder
#### A curated list of all member events so you can plan your next trip. ✈️

## The Ultimate Map 🗺
#### Our map lets you explore around the hackathon's area and see exactly what previous Coaches have recommended. No more getting lost in a random suburb with mid food. 📍

## Vibe Check Recommendations ☕️
#### Find the cutest cafes for that pre-judging caffeine fix, top-rated restaurants that aren’t mid when you're inevitably starving at 11pm, and hotels where you can actually get some rest before the chaos of opening ceremony on Saturday morning. 😴

## Touch Grass Mode 🌱
#### Nearby attractions for when you need to see sunlight after staring at VSCode for 12 hours straight. Think parks, public spaces, and cool attractions that only the locals know. ☀️
